##### Download the repository.

##### After downloading the files you must install on your machine lr-http-server with npm.

##### When you have everything ready go with the command console to the directory where the files are found and type lr-http-server and enter. When executing the command it will tell you a port where it is running and open it in your favorite browser.

##### Otherwise, if you do not want to install anything on your machine, just put it in the javascript parter where it says img.src = 'image.jpg' replace image.jpg with the url of the image you wish to place.
